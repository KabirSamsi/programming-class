# Week 2

### Concepts

* Using a text editor to write Python programs
* Using the command line to execute Python programs

### Instructions

* Download the latest stable release of Python 3 from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you are on MacOS or Windows
    * Run the Python installer
    * **Windows users: Make sure you check the box "Add Python to PATH", this saves a lot of time**

* Download the latest stable release of Adobe Brackets from [Github.com](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/releases)
    * If on Windows, download and run the Brackets installer `.msi`.
    * If on MacOS, download and open the Brackets `.dmg` and drag the `.app` to your Applications folder.
* Make a new folder called `Python` on your `Desktop` folder.
* Write a simple `print("Hello World!")` program and save it as `hello_world.py` to the `Python Programs` folder.
* Open up the Command Prompt or the Terminal and type the following commands:
``` bash
cd Desktop/
cd Python/
python3 hello_world.py # if you're on macOS
python hello_world.py # if you're on Windows
```

* You should see `Hello World!` show up on the screen.
* Congrats! Now you can write more complex programs and execute them through the command line.
