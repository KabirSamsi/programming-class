# Online Resources

Here's a list of useful sites with information about Python and programming in general

* [Python.org](https://python.org) - official site of the Python Software Foundation.
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) - useful site with a lot of tutorials and references, also has a code playground.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - the largest Q&A site for programming. Chances are, your question was already answered, you just need a good Google search. **If you want to ask a question there, make sure it's your last resort - ask a friend first or a teacher/helper**.
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it) - online code playground. Can be used to program on machines that don't necessarily support installation of a certain language.
